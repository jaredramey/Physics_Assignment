WHAT IF you had bouncy pigs but THEN you had to get them into a meat grinder

TREATMENT:
You are a butcher who got a new shipment of pigs in recently. But there is
something different about these ones. They bounce around like a rubber ball.
So you decide to play a little game with them and try to bounce the pigs into
the meat grinder.

MECHANICS:
	- Pigs are super bouncy
	- There are objects in the way
	- Meat Grinder has a cylidrical mouth so pigs can bounce out





PROPOSAL:

3D game in which you fly a helicopter around trying to collect pigs with a claw
attatched to the helicopter via a rope. The goal is to get all the pigs into the
pen. What makes this a difficult task is the fact that the pigs are super bouncy
and will spring off in a random direction whenever they land on their feet.
